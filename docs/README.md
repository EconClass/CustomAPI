# TourPal API

## Overview
This API is designed to enable users to store and access information about landmarks in a city.
It allows users to be able to send json data to the server containing addresses, coordinates and photo urls.
The server then stores the data in a Mongo DB which can then be accessed and manipulated.
The CRUD routes follow RESTful conventions.
